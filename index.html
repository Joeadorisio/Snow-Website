            <p>Mountains are playgrounds when you find the right toy. Carve a slope like the christmas turkey, surf the off piste or take flight off a ramp! All mountainous mayhem excits and enpowers! You just need to find the right toy to get started.</p>
            There are 2 major pieces of kit you will find on the mountains, click on the bar above to find more information about your chosen apparatus.

                Skiing to the unknowing looks a lot like sticking two planks to your feet and sliding down the mountain, which technically it is. But once you get the knack you can achieve high speeds, big air and blizzard like stops.

                Boarding is more like surfing snow. When off piste you glide on a board. Snowboarding complements the skills of skateboarding and surfing. If you have those skills already snowboarding is a must.

                There are many different types of slope, depending on your prefered method of transport you will enjoy different slopes. Four colours indicate the slope you will be encountering: Green, Blue, Red and Black. For the more adventurous souls, attempt the off piste.
            </div>
        <div class="piste1">
            <h4 class="slope">Green Slopes</h4><b class="greenbox">Beginner.</b> Green slopes, these are the least steep. Usually for learning, you will be pressed hard to find greens at the top of the mountain. That being said they are perfect for practising 180<sup class="greenbox">o</sup>'s, 360<sup class="greenbox">o</sup>'s and travelling backwards, or boarding goofy. The shallowness means falling will not slide you to the bottom of the slope! Consider these slopes for improving ability or any first time tricks.
        </div>
        <div class="piste2">
            <h4 class="slope">Blue Slopes</h4><b class="bluebox">Easy.</b> The harsher cousin of the green slope. A blue slope is the most common you will see on any mountain. Quite a lot steeper than the green slope with a gradient less then 25%. If you fall you might well end up at the bottom of the run! Still a very good piste to try tricks and improve technique. Blues can be very wide making them perfect for carving, speedy descents or a little play. Ultimately, you are given enough space to do your thing.
        </div>
        <div class="piste3">
            <h4 class="slope">Red Slopes</h4><b class="redbox">Intermediate.</b> The almighty red slope, can be wide or narrow. Advised not to try anything new unless your comfortable on your mode of transport. Same as the typical blue slope, but these beasts are steeper, not more than 40% gradient. Piles of snow, moguls, built by users turning can appear on the slope. Either dodge the piles, use them as turning points, or take flight off the top. Beware of your landing, hitting another mogul will throw you out of control!
        </div>
        <div class="piste4">
            <h4 class="slope">Black Slopes</h4><b class="blackbox">Expert.</b> The steepest, mogulest and most technically difficult slope. When you fancy 'sending a black slope' make sure you are feeling confident. Blacks can be ambiguous, sometimes a little harder than a red, other times a near to vertical desecent. The black rating is given compared to the other slopes within the resort. Though ambiguous, remember the black slope is always more demanding than the red slope.
        </div>
        <div class="piste5">
            <h4 class="slope">The Off Piste</h4>
            <b class="pinkbox">Intermediate-Expert.</b> The off piste is when you travel off the piste, amazingly. This is the softest yet deepest snow, you will glide across the top like your walking on clouds. Careful as there can be rocks and sudden drops. If you find a spot with a natural lip and no rocks you can start jumping with style assured the landing is a soft crunch in the deep blanket snow. Make sure you lean backwards, forward will cause you to catch the tip of your board or ski and flip you into a snowy faceplant.
